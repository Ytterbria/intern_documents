* What is the Pyramid Principle ? 
It's a structured thinking and communication method. core idea includes : 
1.Start with the conclusion； like a news headline - just give your main point first
2.Top-down communication: main conclusion -> supporting points -> evidence/data
3.Bottom-up thinking: Gather facts,group them,then summarize the conclusion
4.Group logically: use chronology(时序)，cause-effect or structure split
MECE: Multually Exclusive,Collectively Exhausitive(互相独立，完全穷尽)


* Using the Pyramid Principle for Efficient Communication
Formula : Conclusion -> reason -> Details
A popular version is the SCQA framework : 
Situation: the background,  Complication: the problem/conflict
Question: the key question raised, Answer: the solution/conclusion

* Using the Pyramid Principle to Ask Questions
Asking questions with too little context makes the other person dig for details. 
With the Pyramid Principle,your questions are clear and answerable in one step
Structure: Goal : what answer or result you want
Background: current situation,what you've tried,limitations,context
Question: aprecise,anserable question
